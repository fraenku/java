## Relevance
The most important in any searches is to provide relevant results.
There are so measurements helping in that

###Precision
Ratio of true positives versus total number (true positives + true negatives)

###Recall
Ratio f true positives versus sum of all documents that should have been returned (
true p

###Scoring
Scoring is computed:
- TF: Term frequency (the more often a term appears in a field, the more important it is)
- IDF: Inverse term frequency: The more document contain the term, the less important it is (example 'and')
- Field length: The shorter the more relevant

There are a lot of possibilities to improve precision or recall by taking use of the various search-possibilities
(bool-queries, should, filter)

### Inverted index
Term, document-id
Elastic; 2, 30, 50
Kibana; 1, 30, 51, 100

The index is built with the help of analyzers
It is worth to fine-tune the mapping for
